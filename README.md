## Hello there 👋

I'm Jakub, a self-taught machine learning enthusiast with a sound engineering background.

I explore novel architectures, tokenization methods, and representation learning 

## Tools

- Python • PyTorch • NumPy • PyQt
- Experimenting with custom tokenizers and small-scale language models

## A Bit About Me

- 🎵 Former sound engineer / now chasing AI chaos
- 🧠 Self-taught in ML / learning through building and breaking things
- 🌙 Obsessed with phonetic & structural approaches to language modeling
- ☕ Coffee, late-night training runs, and reading way too many papers

Open to feedback, ideas, and collaborations - especially if you're tinkering with tokenization or small-model scaling.

Feel free to open an issue or drop a message!


Made with curiosity & caffeine ☕
